Birds of a feather
Billie Eilish
I want you to stay
'Til I'm in the grave
'Til I ride away, dead and buried
'Til I'm in the casket you carried
If you go, I'm going too, oh
'Cause it was always you, oh

And if I'm turning blue, please don't save me

Nothing left to lose without my baby



Birds of a feather, we should stick together

I know I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone

Can't change the weather, might not be forever

But if it's forever, it's even better



And I don't know what I'm crying for

I don't think I could love you more

It might not be long, but, baby, I



I'll love you 'til the day that I die

'Til the day that I die

'Til the light leaves my eyes

'Til the day that I die



I want you to see, oh

All you mean to me, oh

You wouldn't believe if I told ya

Who we would become, laments I wrote ya

But you're so full of shit, oh

Tell me it's a bit, oh

Say you don't see it, your mind's all brooding

Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid



And I don't know what I'm crying for

I don't think I could love you more

Might not be long, but, baby, but I

Don't wanna say goodbye



(Birds of a feather, we should stick together)

'Til the day that I die

(I know I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone)

'Til the light leaves my eyes

(Can't change the weather, might not be forever)

'Til the day that I die

But if it's forever, it's even better



How do you do nothing?

You had the same look in your eyes

I love you, don't act so surprised
