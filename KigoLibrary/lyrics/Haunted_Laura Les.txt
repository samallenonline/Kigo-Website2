Haunted
Laura Les
Am I going insane? Running, running through the back alley
Blood all over and you know I've had enough
Am I going insane? Running, running through the back alley
Blood all over and you know I've had enough
Am I going insane? Running, running through the back alley
Blood all over and you know I've had enough

Am I going insane? Running, running through the back alley

Blood all over and you know I've hadâ€”



Do you think it's cute that I'm so fucking stupid?

Tell me that it is, 'cause I'm tired of being useless (Yeah)

I've been up for three days, everything is haunted

Everybody's evil and there's bugs inside the carpet

Do you think I'm frightening? Organ chords and lightning

If I show my fangs, will you tell me that they're cool?

Mirrors shatter when I'm passing, broken glass and crashing

Little blurry stars scattered all across my room



Am I going insane? Running, running through the back alley

Blood all over and you know I've had enough

Am I going insane? Running, running through the back alley

Blood all over and you know I've had enough

Am I going insane? Running, running through the back alley

Blood all over and you know I've had enough

Am I going insane? Running, running through the back alley

Blood all over and you know I've had enough
