Sailor Song
Gigi Perez
I saw her in the rightest way
Looking like Anne Hathaway
Laughing while she hit her pen
And coughed, and coughed
And then, she came up to my knees
Begging, baby, would you please?

Do the things you said you'd do to me, to me



Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?

And when you get a taste, can you tell me what's my flavor?

I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior

My mom says that she's worried, but I'm covered in this favor

And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong

I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long

I sleep so I can see you and I hate to wait so long



She took my fingers to her mouth

The kind of thing that makes you proud

That nothing else had ever

Worked out, worked out

And lately, I've tried other things

But nothing can capture the sting

Of the venom, she's gonna spit out right now



Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?

And when you get a taste, can you tell me what's my flavor?

I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior

I know that you've been worried, but the truth is in my favor

And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong

I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long

I sleep so I can see you and I hate to wait so long



And we can run away to the walls inside your house

I can be the cat, baby, you can be the mouse

And we can laugh off things that we know nothing about

We can go forever until you wanna sit it out
