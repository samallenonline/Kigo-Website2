That's so True
Gracie Abrams
I could go and read your mind
Think about your dumb face all the time
Living in your glass house, I'm outside
Mm, looking in her big blue eyes
Did it just to hurt me, make me cry
Smiling through it all, yeah, that's my life



You're an idiot, now I'm sure

Now I'm positive, I should go and warn her



Ooh, bet you're thinking, "She's so cool"

Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room

Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh



What'd she do to get you off? (Uh-huh)

Taking down her hair like, oh my God

Taking off your shirt, I did that once

Or twice, ah

No, I know, and I'll fuck off

But I think I like her, she's so fun

Wait, I think I hate her, I'm not that evolved



I'm sorry she's missing it, sad, sad boy

Not my business, but I had to warn her



Ooh, bet you're thinking, "She's so cool"

Kicking back on the couch, making eyes from across the room

Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh

Oh, ooh

You've got me thinking, "She's so cool"

But I know what I know and you're just another dude

Ooh, that's so true, ooh



Made it out alive, but I think I lost it

Said that I was fine, said it from my coffin

Remember how I died when you started walking?

That's my life, that's my life

I'll put up a fight, taking out my earrings

Don't you know the vibe? Don't you know the feeling?

Can't you spend the night? Catch me on your ceiling

That's your price, that's your price



Well, mm, you've got me thinking, "She's so cool"

Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room

Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh, ooh

Ah, ooh, you've got me thinking, "She's so cool"

But I know what I know and you're just another dude

Ooh, that's so true, ooh, ooh, oh
