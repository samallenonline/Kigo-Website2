Disintegration
The Cure
Oh I miss the kiss of treachery 
The shameless kiss of vanity 
The soft and the black and the velvety 
Up tight against the side of me 
And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed 
And run in thickening streams of greed 

As bit by bit it starts the need 

To just let go 

My party piece 



Oh I miss the kiss of treachery 

The aching kiss before I feed 

The stench of a love for a younger meat 

And the sound that it makes 

When it cuts in deep 

The holding up on bended knees 

The addiction of duplicities 

As bit by bit it starts the need 

To just let go 

My party piece 



But I never said I would stay to the end 

So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency 

Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy 

Screaming me over and over and over 

I leave you with photographs 

Pictures of trickery 

Stains on the carpet and 

Stains on the scenery 

Songs about happiness murmured in dreams 

When we both us knew 

How the ending would be... 



So it's all come back round to breaking apart again 

Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again 

Making it up behind my back again 

Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again 

Holding it up behind my head again 

Cut in deep to the heart of the bone again 

Round and round and round 

And it's coming apart again 

Over and over and over 



Now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces 

I'll pull out my heart 

And I'll feed it to anyone 

Crying for sympathy 

Crocodiles cry for the love of the crowd 

And the three cheers from everyone 

Dropping through sky 

Through the glass of the roof 

Through the roof of your mouth 

Through the mouth of your eye 

Through the eye of the needle 

It's easier for me to get closer to heaven 

Than ever feel whole again 



I never said I would stay to the end 

I knew I would leave you with babies and everything 

Screaming like this in the hole of sincerity 

Screaming me over and over and over 

I leave you with photographs 

Pictures of trickery 

Stains on the carpet and 

Stains on the memory 

Songs about happiness murmured in dreams 

When we both of us knew 

How the end always is 



How the end always is...
